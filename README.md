# Humphrey Mark's Year 2 Computer Science Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Katabalwa Humphrey Mark**, and this repository contains the coding projects and assignments I completed during **Year 2** of my **Computer Science** course. The projects showcase my learning in areas such as programming, data structures, algorithms, networking, and software development.

## About the Repository
- Each folder or file represents a specific project or assignment.
- The codes are written primarily in languages such as **Java**, **C++**, and other languages I used during my course.
- Some projects also include networking simulations and other practical exercises done during the course.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Networking & VLAN configuration  
- Java and C++ programming  
- Problem-solving & logical thinking  

## How to Use
1. Browse the folders to explore individual projects.  
2. Open the code files in your preferred IDE or code editor.  
3. Run the programs as instructed in their respective files (if applicable).  

## Goals
